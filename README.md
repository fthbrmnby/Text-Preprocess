# Text-Preprocess
Text preprocessing pipeline for my graduation project. Pipeline includes sentence boundary detection, sentence tokenizer, stemmer and disambugiator. This pipeline uses Turkish NLP library [zemberek-nlp](https://github.com/ahmetaa/zemberek-nlp) by Ahmet A. AkÄ±n and [Turkish Deasciifier for Java](https://github.com/ahmetb/turkish-deasciifier-java) by Ahmet Alp Balkan.
